## After years of hearing people compare Minecraft to Lego, I have transformed Minecraft's original cubes into the plastic building toy enjoyed by many!

I actually made this a few months ago and am just updating it to work better with more modern Minecraft. Works best with smooth lighting off.

### To Use
To use, download the zip file and put that folder (you don't have to unzip but it is advised) in the resource pack folder.
They can be found here:
```
Windows: %appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks
GNU/Linux: ~/.minecraft/resourcepacks (This folder may be hidden in the Home folder)
macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/resourcepacks (This folder may be hidden)
```

## Change Log
 - January 16, 2023: Actually Created The Pack
 - June 21, 2023: Updated Pack Format
 - August 28, 2023: Updated the Lego Pack's description and added this file
