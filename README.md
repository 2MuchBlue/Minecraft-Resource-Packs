# About My Minecraft Resource Packs
The Place I Put Some of the Resource Pack I Made!

Please don't steal my stuff but you are 
more than welcome to use/expand on this, if you do, it would be great to get credit but I won't send anyone after you :P
Anyway, have fun playing with legos, 8x8 textures, or anything else I decide to make!

## To Download A Pack
FYI! All Of These Are Made For The Java Edition Of Minecraft! These Won't Work In Bedrock!

you can download a pack by going into that repositry, navigation into the zipped file (.zip) and clicking "view raw",
then, once downloaded, put it into your resource packs folder which are found here:

        Windows: %appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks
        GNU/Linux: ~/.minecraft/resourcepacks (This folder may be hidden in the Home folder)
        macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/resourcepacks (This folder may be hidden)

All the files in the zip should reflect the ones in the non zipped folders of the same names.
